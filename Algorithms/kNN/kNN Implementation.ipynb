    "K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm can be used for both classification (data with discrete variables) and regression (data with continuous labels). The algorithm functions by calculating the distance (Sci-Kit Learn uses the formula for Euclidean distance but other formulas are available) between instances to create local \"neighborhoods\". K-Nearest Neighbors functions by maximizing the homogeneity amongst instances within a neighborhood while also maximizing the heterogeneity of instances between neighborhoods. So each member of a given neighborhood “looks like” (has similar variables) all of the other members of that neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "One neat feature of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is the number of neighborhoods can be user defined or generated by the algorithm using the local density of points.\n",
